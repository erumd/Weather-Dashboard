# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Used Open Weather API to create a dynamic weather website. Using the API allowed me to access the data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. The website gives current weather temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, UV index, date, and icon representation of current weather conditions. A five day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

I want to thank my classmates Iyana and Will for helping me on this app as well as my tutor.

Resources used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), bootstrap, W3 Schools, and Stackoverflow

 
Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.



## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history


WHEN I view the UV index***
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
